Select Slot: Navigate to your desired date using the "Prev" and "Next" buttons. Click on a time slot that shows as "Available" or has "Spots left".

Time Selection: A modal will appear allowing you to select your **End Time**. The system will display the total duration (e.g., "1.5 hrs"). If you are satisfied, click "Continue to Booking".

*   Enter and confirm your Email Address.
*   Dgroup Leader: Enter the name of your Dgroup leader.
*   Event: Select the type of event.

Done: You will see a success message with a **Booking Code**. You will also receive a confirmation email with a link to add the event to your Google Calendar.
